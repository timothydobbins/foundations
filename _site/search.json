    "text": "This is a placeholder website to provide information about PHCM9795: Foundations of Biostatistics.\n\nWelcome\nWelcome to PHCM9795 Foundations of Biostatistics.\nThis is an introductory course in biostatistics for postgraduate students. The course aims to provide students with core biostatistical skills to analyse and present quantitative data from different study types. These are essential skills required in your degree and throughout your career.\nWe suggest that you read through this course outline in full to gain an understanding of the course aims, structure and assessment requirements.\nWe hope you enjoy the course and will value your feedback and comment throughout the course.\n\n\nCourse information\nBiostatistics is a foundational discipline needed for the analysis and interpretation of quantitative information and its application to population health policy and practice.\nThis course is central to becoming a population health practitioner as the concepts and techniques developed in the course are fundamental to your studies and practice in population health. In this course you will develop an understanding of, and skills in, the core concepts of biostatistics that are necessary for analysis and interpretation of population health data and health literature.\nIn designing this course, we provide a learning sequence that will allow you to obtain the required graduate capabilities identified for your program. This course is taught with an emphasis on formulating a hypothesis and quantifying the evidence in relation to a specific research question. You will have the opportunity to analyse data from different study types commonly seen in population health research.\nThe course will allow those of you who have covered some of this material in your undergraduate and other professional education to consolidate your knowledge and skills.  Students exposed to biostatistics for the first time may find the course challenging at times. Based on student feedback, the key to success in this course is to devote time to it every week. We recommend that you spend an average of 10-15 hours per week on the course, including the time spent reading the course notes and readings, listening to lectures, and working through learning activities and completing your assessments. Please use the resources provided to assist you, including online support."

    "text": "In this course, you will have the choice to use one of two packages: Stata or R.\nStata is an excellent statistics package which is relatively easy to learn, and covers virtually all the methods a researcher in population health would need. Students can access Stata software on some computers in the Wallace Wurth Building computer laboratory on Monday evenings 6-8pm (during the scheduled clinics – see timetable). This computer laboratory is also available to students on other weekdays and times when other classes are not scheduled. You can also access Stata remotely via https://www.myaccess.unsw.edu.au/ . Please note that there is a 40-user limit on accessing Stata remotely.\nIf you are not able to access Stata, you can purchase your own license. We use Stata/BE Version 17 for this course. Stata/BE is the Basic Edition of Stata and is more than enough to carry out all the tasks in an introductory level as well as advanced level biostatistics course. Students can buy a 6-month license for AUD$81 or a one-year license for AUD$157 from https://www.stata-au.com/ (Note that prices are correct as of March 2023).\nOlder versions of Stata (down to version 11) will also be suitable for this course.\nThe R language is becoming a popular choice for biostatistics due to its flexibility and its power. Additionally, as R is an open-source project, it is available at no cost. While R has a cost advantage, it does have a reputation of being difficult to learn.\nIf you choose to use R, we recommend running R via a package called RStudio. Both R and RStudio are available for Windows and Mac (and Linux!) machines, and are available at no cost. Installation instructions will be provided in the course materials."
