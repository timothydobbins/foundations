4. Using **Windows Explorer**, navigate to the folder you have saved your data into. You will see a new file, called something like "OneDrive_2025...":

5. Click the file once, and then click **Extract all** at the top of the window:

6. You can specify the location for the files to be extracted. I recommend deleting the "OneDrive_2025..." text. This will extract your files directly into the "Foundations of Biostatistics" folder. Click **Extract**:
