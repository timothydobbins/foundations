In this course, you can choose to learn **one** of two packages: [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/){.external target="_blank"} **or** [R](https://www.r-project.org/){.external target="_blank"}.

jamovi is a relatively new package that has been designed to be easy to use. It is a free, open-source package, that is built on top of the R programming language. jamovi is based around a spreadsheet, and has an intuitive point-and-click interface. jamovi is available to download for Windows, macOS and linux at [https://www.jamovi.org/download.html](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html){.external target="_blank"}. I recommend using the latest version of jamovi, currently "jamovi 2.7.13 current" where possible.

R is a programming language, which is a popular choice for biostatistics due to its flexibility and its power. Additionally, as R is an open-source project, it is available at no cost. While R is very powerful, it does have a reputation of being difficult to learn.

If you choose to use R, I recommend running R via a package called [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){.external target="_blank"}. Both R and RStudio are available for Windows and Mac (and Linux!) machines, and are available at no cost. Installation instructions will be provided in the course materials.

### Summary

You should learn jamovi if:

- you prefer using point-and-click commands, and
- you don't want to learn to code.

You should learn R if:

- you are interested in learning to code (with lots of helpful instruction!);
- you are interested in data science;
- you are comfortable with file paths, and don't mind a bit of debugging.

**If you are in doubt, I recommend learning jamovi.**
