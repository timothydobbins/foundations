    "text": "In this course, you can choose to learn one of two packages: jamovi or R.\njamovi is a relatively new package, that has been designed to be easy to use. It is a free, open-source package, that is built on top of the R programming language. jamovi is based around a spreadsheet, and has an intuitive point-and-click interface. jamovi is available to download for Windows, macOS and linux at https://www.jamovi.org/download.html. We recommend using “jamovi 2.6.26 solid” where possible.\nR is a programming language, which is a popular choice for biostatistics due to its flexibility and its power. Additionally, as R is an open-source project, it is available at no cost. While R has a cost advantage, it does have a reputation of being difficult to learn.\nIf you choose to use R, we recommend running R via a package called RStudio. Both R and RStudio are available for Windows and Mac (and Linux!) machines, and are available at no cost. Installation instructions will be provided in the course materials.\n\nSummary\nYou should learn jamovi if:\n\nyou prefer using point-and-click commands, and\nyou don’t want to learn to code.\n\nYou should learn R if:\n\nyou are interested in learning to code (with lots of helpful instruction!);\nyou are interested in data science;\nyou are comfortable with file paths, and don’t mind a bit of debugging.\n\nUltimately, if in doubt, I’d lean towards learning jamovi.",

These fundamental skills will help you in your studies and throughout your career.\n\n\nCourse information\nHow can we use data to tell a story?\n\nHow can we show whether COVID-19 cases are increasing over time?\nHow can we estimate the smoking rate in Australia?\nHow can we assess whether a new treatment reduces pain in patients with arthritis?\n\nWelcome to Foundations of Biostatistics. In this course, we will introduce you to fundamental data visualisation skills to create meaningful and appealing graphical summaries of your data. We will explore which numeric summaries are best to describe your data, discuss why there is variability in these summaries and how to represent this variability. We will show how to test hypotheses to answer real-world research questions. Finally, we will explore how many participants should be enrolled to provide robust conclusions when designing a study.\nThe core course can be studied in an online or in-person mode (or a mixture of both), and teaches you to how to obtain and interpret biostatistical output using software, while minimising mathematical formulae.\nWe invite you to learn how to tell a story using data.",

And don’t feel like you need to formally enrol, or study every section: just watch some of the videos and read some of the notes for the topics that you might not remember - and maybe take some of the quizzes.

    "text": "Course Aim and Philosophy\nThe primary aim of this course is to equip students with the ability to “tell a story with data.” While theoretical foundations will be covered, the emphasis is firmly on understanding how to communicate ideas clearly and concisely using data. The course is designed to be applied, focusing on practical implications rather than extensive formulas, making it accessible to non-statisticians.\n\n“I want you to be able to tell a story with data.”",

    "text": "Course Structure and Delivery\nThe course runs over 10 weeks, with each week dedicated to a different module. The weekly structure typically involves:\n\nReviewing Course Notes (Optional, before Tuesday): Students are encouraged to briefly review the notes if time permits.\nLecture (Tuesday, 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM): Held in person and simultaneously available live on Microsoft Teams. Recordings are posted on Tuesday afternoon.\nAttempting Learning Activities (After Lecture): Students should attempt the learning activities at the end of each module. Practice is highlighted as the best way to learn.\nTutorial (Thursday): In-person classroom tutorials are available, with the software used (jamovi or R) determining the specific session. Online tutorials are held at the same time on Thursday evenings via Microsoft Teams. Tutorials are recorded.\nReviewing Answers (After Learning Activities): Students should review the sample solutions to understand approaches and compare them to their own work.\nMoodle Discussion Boards (Throughout the Week): Open for questions and discussions on module content, software, and general topics.\n\n\nThere is no formal attendance requirement for any sessions. All online sessions are recorded and made available, allowing for flexible learning.",

This site will also be linked from Moodle.\nMicrosoft Teams: Used for live online lectures, online tutorials, and booking software clinic appointments. Students must log in using their University of New South Wales zID.\n\nThe course notes are considered sufficient, and purchasing textbooks is not necessary.",

If in doubt, leaning towards jamovi is recommended for ease of use.",
