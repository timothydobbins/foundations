For example, does the course require university-level mathematics?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are no prerequisite maths skills - you certainly don’t need to have studied mathematics or statistics at university. I will touch on some high-school maths, but very infrequently. It’s been a long time since I’ve studies maths, and I’m feeling nervous. Are there any preparatory courses I should study?\nIf it has been a while since you have studied maths, the resources from Unit 1 of the Algebra Basics from the Khan Academy might be useful.\nDon’t worry that it’s got “algebra” in its title, it’s just some basic maths skills that you might not remember so well. And don’t feel like you need to formally enrol, or study every section: just watch some of the videos and read some of the notes for the topics that you might not remember - and maybe take some of the quizzes. I would recommend the section on “Order of Operations”, but you can definitely skip “Area of triangles” and “Circumference and area of circles”."

There are also two assignments, each worth 40% of the course. The dates for these assessments will be released when the course outline is published."

    "text": "This website provides information about PHCM9795: Foundations of Biostatistics.\n\nWelcome\nWelcome to PHCM9795 Foundations of Biostatistics.\nThis is an introductory course in biostatistics which will teach you core skills to analyse and present quantitative data from different study types. These fundamental skills will help you in your studies and throughout your career.\n\n\nCourse information\nHow can we use data to tell a story?\n\nHow can we show whether COVID-19 cases are increasing over time?\nHow can we estimate the smoking rate in Australia?\nHow can we assess whether a new treatment reduces pain in patients with arthritis?\n\nWelcome to Foundations of Biostatistics. In this course, we will introduce you to fundamental data visualisation skills to create meaningful and appealing graphical summaries of your data. We will explore which numeric summaries are best to describe your data, discuss why there is variability in these summaries and how to represent this variability. We will show how to test hypotheses to answer real-world research questions. Finally, we will explore how many participants should be enrolled to provide robust conclusions when designing a study.\nThe core course can be studied in an online or in-person mode (or a mixture of both), and teaches you to how to obtain and interpret biostatistical output using software, while minimising mathematical formulae. We will demonstrate output using two of the most commonly used biostatistics and data science software packages today: Stata and R, and you can choose which package you would like to learn.\nWe invite you to learn how to tell a story using data."

    "text": "In this course, you can choose to learn one of two packages: Stata or R.\nStata is an excellent statistics package which is relatively easy to learn, and covers virtually all the methods a researcher in population health would need. You can access Stata remotely via https://www.myaccess.unsw.edu.au/ . Please note that there is a 40-user limit on accessing Stata remotely.\nIf you are not able to access Stata, or if you find myAccess inconvenient, you can purchase your own license. We use Stata/BE Version 18 for this course. Stata/BE is the Basic Edition of Stata and is more than enough to carry out all the tasks in an introductory level as well as advanced level biostatistics course. You can buy a 6-month license for AUD$82 or a one-year license for AUD$160 from https://www.stata-au.com/ (Note that prices are correct as of December 2023).\nR is becoming a popular choice for biostatistics due to its flexibility and its power. Additionally, as R is an open-source project, it is available at no cost. While R has a cost advantage, it does have a reputation of being difficult to learn.\nIf you choose to use R, we recommend running R via a package called RStudio. Both R and RStudio are available for Windows and Mac (and Linux!) machines, and are available at no cost. Installation instructions will be provided in the course materials.\n\nSummary\nI recommend learning Stata if:\n\nyou are happy using point-and-click commands, and\nyou don’t want to learn to code.\n\nI recommend learning R if:\n\nyou are interested in learning to code (with lots of helpful instruction!);\nyou are interested in data science;\nyou are comfortable with file paths, and don’t mind a bit of debugging.\n\nUltimately, if in doubt, I’d lean towards learning Stata."
