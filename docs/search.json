    "text": "This website provides information about PHCM9795: Foundations of Biostatistics.\n\nWelcome\nWelcome to PHCM9795 Foundations of Biostatistics.\nThis is an introductory course in biostatistics which will teach you core skills to analyse and present quantitative data from different study types. These are essential skills required in your degree and throughout your career.\n\n\nCourse information\nBiostatistics is a foundational discipline needed for the analysis and interpretation of quantitative information and its application to population health policy and practice.\nThis course is central to becoming a population health practitioner as the concepts and techniques developed in the course are fundamental to your studies and practice in population health. In this course you will develop an understanding of, and skills in, the core concepts of biostatistics that are necessary for analysis and interpretation of population health data and health literature.\nIn designing this course, we provide a learning sequence that will allow you to obtain the required graduate capabilities identified for your program. This course is taught with an emphasis on formulating a hypothesis and quantifying the evidence in relation to a specific research question. You will have the opportunity to analyse data from different study types commonly seen in population health research.\nThe course will allow those of you who have covered some of this material in your undergraduate and other professional education to consolidate your knowledge and skills.  Students exposed to biostatistics for the first time may find the course challenging at times. Based on student feedback, the key to success in this course is to devote time to it every week. We recommend that you spend an average of 10-15 hours per week on the course, including the time spent reading the course notes and readings, listening to lectures, and working through learning activities and completing your assessments. Please use the resources provided to assist you, including online support."

    "text": "Can Foundations of Biostatistics course be completed entirely remotely? Are there any attendance requirements?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no requirement to attend any in-person events. Many students don’t come to campus, and the course is designed to be accessible by all students. In fact, many students have completed the course while living overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there any prerequisites or any expected background knowledge for this course?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo! There are no prerequisite mathematics requirements, and you do not need to have studied statistics before.\nIf it has been a while since you have studied maths, the following resources from Unit 1 of the Algebra Basics from the Khan Academy might be useful:\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics/basic-alg-foundations\nDon’t worry that it’s got “algebra” in its title, it’s just some basic maths skills that you might not remember so well. And don’t feel like you need to formally enrol, or study every section: just watch some of the videos and read some of the notes for the topics that you might not remember - and maybe take some of the quizzes. I would recommend the section on “Order of Operations”, but you can definitely skip “Area of triangles” and “Circumference and area of circles”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can only study one course this term. Should I study Foundations of Biostatistics or Foundations of Epidemiology?\n\n\n\n\n\nMany students put off studying Foundations of Biostatistics in the (mistaken) belief that it will be too difficult. Please don’t do this! Foundations of Biostatistics is designed to be accessible for all students, regardless of your maths background.\ncompleting either Epidemiology first or Biostatistics first would be fine. Last year, the first year these courses ran, there were slightly more students doing Epidemiology – so we think more students chose to complete Epidemiology first.\nYour future course choices and your timetable might help you answer this. For example, if you know you want to complete Epidemiological Methods, then completing Epi first would be sensible. If you know you want to complete Advanced Biostatistics (to be called Regression Methods in Biostatistics from 2023), completing Biostatistics first would be useful.\nSo basically, there’s no “right” course to be completed first. You will get a lot out of either course, whatever you decide to complete first.\n\n\n\nDo you have a question that is not answered here? Please email me, and I can provide an answer."

    "text": "In this course, you can choose to learn one of two packages: Stata or R.\nStata is an excellent statistics package which is relatively easy to learn, and covers virtually all the methods a researcher in population health would need. Students can access Stata software on some computers in the Wallace Wurth Building computer laboratory on Monday evenings 6-8pm (during the scheduled clinics – see timetable). This computer laboratory is also available to students on other weekdays and times when other classes are not scheduled. You can also access Stata remotely via https://www.myaccess.unsw.edu.au/ . Please note that there is a 40-user limit on accessing Stata remotely.\nIf you are not able to access Stata, you can purchase your own license. We use Stata/BE Version 17 for this course. Stata/BE is the Basic Edition of Stata and is more than enough to carry out all the tasks in an introductory level as well as advanced level biostatistics course. Students can buy a 6-month license for AUD$81 or a one-year license for AUD$157 from https://www.stata-au.com/ (Note that prices are correct as of March 2023).\nOlder versions of Stata (down to version 11) will also be suitable for this course.\nR is becoming a popular choice for biostatistics due to its flexibility and its power. Additionally, as R is an open-source project, it is available at no cost. While R has a cost advantage, it does have a reputation of being difficult to learn.\nIf you choose to use R, we recommend running R via a package called RStudio. Both R and RStudio are available for Windows and Mac (and Linux!) machines, and are available at no cost. Installation instructions will be provided in the course materials."
