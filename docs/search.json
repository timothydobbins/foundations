    "text": "Can Foundations of Biostatistics course be completed entirely remotely? Are there any attendance requirements?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no requirement to attend any in-person events.

In fact, many students have completed the course while living overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve heard the workload\n\n\n\n\n\nBleep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can only study one course this term. Should I study Foundations of Biostatistics or Foundations of Epidemiology?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no right answer to this question - completing either course first would be fine.\nMany students put off studying Foundations of Biostatistics in the (mistaken) belief that it will be too difficult - and then report that they wish they had studied the course earlier. Foundations of Biostatistics is designed to be accessible for all students, regardless of your maths background.\nYour future course choices and your timetable might help you answer this. For example, if you know you want to complete Regression Methods in Biostatistics, then completing Foundations of Biostatistics first would be sensible.\nThere’s no “right” course to be completed first. You will get a lot out of either course, whatever you decide to complete first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there any prerequisites or any expected background knowledge for this course?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo! There are no prerequisite mathematics requirements, and you do not need to have studied statistics before.\nIf it has been a while since you have studied maths, the following resources from Unit 1 of the Algebra Basics from the Khan Academy might be useful:\nlink\nDon’t worry that it’s got “algebra” in its title, it’s just some basic maths skills that you might not remember so well. And don’t feel like you need to formally enrol, or study every section: just watch some of the videos and read some of the notes for the topics that you might not remember - and maybe take some of the quizzes. I would recommend the section on “Order of Operations”, but you can definitely skip “Area of triangles” and “Circumference and area of circles”"

No, you will need to change your enrolment to internal if you would like to attend the face-to-face tutorial classes. You will need to do this before the end of week 1. However, you are welcome to attend the Monday night Stata clinics as an external student if you live in Sydney. We schedule weekly webinar tutorials for external students.\nI am an external student, can I attend the lectures? Yes! You can watch our lectures online (Thursdays 6-8pm) via MS Teams, or watch a recording later. If you’re keen to come to the lecture in person, feel free to contact me before the session.\nI am an internal student, how do I find which tutorial class I have been allocated to? We will announce tutorial allocation at the end of Week 1."

    "text": "Computing and other course resources FAQs\n\nDo I need to buy Stata? Unless you have access to Stata through work or are regularly able to access campus computers, you will need to purchase Stata. You will need it to complete Module Learning Activities and the assessments. Details about how to purchase Stata are in the course outline.\nI have an old version of Stata, can I use it? ​​​​​​Yes. We use Stata/BE (Basic Edition) Version 18 for this course. Older version of Stata down to version 11 will also be suitable for this course.\nWhere can I access Stata on campus? We have secured licenses for Stata on the computer labs in the Wallace Wurth Building G06/07. This is where the residential workshop and Monday night sessions are held. You can gain access anytime there isn’t a class.\nDo I need to buy a calculator? No. We no longer have an supervised exam for this course and all assessments can be completed using a computer.\nCan I buy a hard-copy of the course notes? We no longer provide printed copies of our course notes due to low interest. You can download the course notes in PDF for printing.\nDo I need to buy a text book?\n\nYou do not need to buy a text book.\nAll the content you need for this course is provided in the course notes, including instructions for Stata. If you want to supplement the content we provide, recommended readings are provided for each module. You can purchase these books or access them through the UNSW library as an e-book. The links are in the course outline.\n\nWhere can I find a private tutor? You may contact the course convenors to request a list of potential private tutors. These are PhD students from our School and affiliated research centres. If you do not live in Sydney/can’t come on campus, you may organise online sessions with your tutor. Note that payment to private tutors is a private arrangement between you and the tutor - we only provide contact details."

    "text": "This website provides information about PHCM9795: Foundations of Biostatistics.\n\nWelcome\nWelcome to PHCM9795 Foundations of Biostatistics.\nThis is an introductory course in biostatistics which will teach you core skills to analyse and present quantitative data from different study types. These fundamental skills will help you in your studies and throughout your career.\n\n\nCourse information\nHow can we use data to tell a story?\n\nHow can we show whether COVID-19 cases are increasing over time?\nHow can we estimate the smoking rate in Australia?\nHow can we assess whether a new treatment reduces pain in patients with arthritis?\n\nWelcome to Foundations of Biostatistics. In this course, we will introduce you to fundamental data visualisation skills to create meaningful and appealing graphical summaries of your data. We will explore which numeric summaries are best to describe your data, discuss why there is variability in these summaries and how to represent this variability. We will show how to test hypotheses to answer real-world research questions. Finally, we will explore how many participants should be enrolled to provide robust conclusions when designing a study.\nThe core course can be studied in an online or in-person mode (or a mixture of both), and teaches you to how to obtain and interpret biostatistical output using software, while minimising mathematical formulae. We will demonstrate output using two of the most commonly used biostatistics and data science software packages today: Stata and R, and you can choose which package you would like to learn.\nWe invite you to learn how to tell a story using data."

    "text": "In this course, you can choose to learn one of two packages: Stata or R.\nStata is an excellent statistics package which is relatively easy to learn, and covers virtually all the methods a researcher in population health would need. You can access Stata remotely via https://www.myaccess.unsw.edu.au/ . Please note that there is a 40-user limit on accessing Stata remotely.\nIf you are not able to access Stata, or if you find myAccess inconvenient, you can purchase your own license. We use Stata/BE Version 18 for this course. Stata/BE is the Basic Edition of Stata and is more than enough to carry out all the tasks in an introductory level as well as advanced level biostatistics course. You can buy a 6-month license for AUD$82 or a one-year license for AUD$160 from https://www.stata-au.com/ (Note that prices are correct as of December 2023).\nR is becoming a popular choice for biostatistics due to its flexibility and its power. Additionally, as R is an open-source project, it is available at no cost. While R has a cost advantage, it does have a reputation of being difficult to learn.\nIf you choose to use R, we recommend running R via a package called RStudio. Both R and RStudio are available for Windows and Mac (and Linux!) machines, and are available at no cost. Installation instructions will be provided in the course materials."
