These fundamental skills will help you in your studies and throughout your career.\n\n\nCourse information\nHow can we use data to tell a story?\n\nHow can we show whether COVID-19 cases are increasing over time?\nHow can we estimate the smoking rate in Australia?\nHow can we assess whether a new treatment reduces pain in patients with arthritis?\n\nWelcome to Foundations of Biostatistics. In this course, we will introduce you to fundamental data visualisation skills to create meaningful and appealing graphical summaries of your data. We will explore which numeric summaries are best to describe your data, discuss why there is variability in these summaries and how to represent this variability. We will show how to test hypotheses to answer real-world research questions. Finally, we will explore how many participants should be enrolled to provide robust conclusions when designing a study.\nThe core course can be studied in an online or in-person mode (or a mixture of both), and teaches you to how to obtain and interpret biostatistical output using software, while minimising mathematical formulae.\nWe invite you to learn how to tell a story using data."

I will touch on some high-school maths, but very infrequently. It’s been a long time since I’ve studies maths, and I’m feeling nervous. Are there any preparatory courses I should study?\nIf it has been a while since you have studied maths, the resources from Unit 1 of the Algebra Basics from the Khan Academy might be useful.\nDon’t worry that it’s got “algebra” in its title, it’s just some basic maths skills that you might not remember so well. And don’t feel like you need to formally enrol, or study every section: just watch some of the videos and read some of the notes for the topics that you might not remember - and maybe take some of the quizzes. I would recommend the section on “Order of Operations”, but you can definitely skip “Area of triangles” and “Circumference and area of circles”."

It is a free, open-source package, that is built on top of the R programming language. jamovi is based around a spreadsheet, and has an intuitive point-and-click interface. jamovi is available to download for Windows, macOS and linux at https://www.jamovi.org/download.html. We recommend using “jamovi 2.6.26 solid” where possible.\nR is a programming language, which is a popular choice for biostatistics due to its flexibility and its power. Additionally, as R is an open-source project, it is available at no cost. While R has a cost advantage, it does have a reputation of being difficult to learn.\nIf you choose to use R, we recommend running R via a package called RStudio. Both R and RStudio are available for Windows and Mac (and Linux!) machines, and are available at no cost. Installation instructions will be provided in the course materials.\n\nSummary\nYou should learn jamovi if:\n\nyou prefer using point-and-click commands, and\nyou don’t want to learn to code.\n\nYou should learn R if:\n\nyou are interested in learning to code (with lots of helpful instruction!);\nyou are interested in data science;\nyou are comfortable with file paths, and don’t mind a bit of debugging.\n\nUltimately, if in doubt, I’d lean towards learning jamovi."
