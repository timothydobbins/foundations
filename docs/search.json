    "text": "In this course, you can choose to learn one of two packages: jamovi or R.\njamovi is a relatively new package that has been designed to be easy to use. It is a free, open-source package, that is built on top of the R programming language. jamovi is based around a spreadsheet, and has an intuitive point-and-click interface. jamovi is available to download for Windows, macOS and linux at https://www.jamovi.org/download.html. I recommend using the latest version of jamovi, currently “jamovi 2.7.13 current” where possible.\nR is a programming language, which is a popular choice for biostatistics due to its flexibility and its power. Additionally, as R is an open-source project, it is available at no cost. While R is very powerful, it does have a reputation of being difficult to learn.\nIf you choose to use R, I recommend running R via a package called RStudio. Both R and RStudio are available for Windows and Mac (and Linux!) machines, and are available at no cost. Installation instructions will be provided in the course materials.\n\nSummary\nYou should learn jamovi if:\n\nyou prefer using point-and-click commands, and\nyou don’t want to learn to code.\n\nYou should learn R if:\n\nyou are interested in learning to code (with lots of helpful instruction!);\nyou are interested in data science;\nyou are comfortable with file paths, and don’t mind a bit of debugging.\n\nIf you are in doubt, I recommend learning jamovi.",

    "text": "Welcome\nWelcome to PHCM9795 Foundations of Biostatistics.\nThis is an introductory course in biostatistics which will teach you core skills to analyse and present quantitative data from different study types. These fundamental skills will help you in your studies and throughout your career.\n\n\nCourse information\nHow can we use data to tell a story?\n\nHow can we show whether COVID-19 cases are increasing over time?\nHow can we estimate the smoking rate in Australia?\nHow can we assess whether a new treatment reduces pain in patients with arthritis?\n\nWelcome to Foundations of Biostatistics. In this course, I will introduce you to fundamental data visualisation skills to create meaningful and appealing graphical summaries of your data. We will explore which numeric summaries are best to describe your data, discuss why there is variability in these summaries and how to represent this variability. I will show how to test hypotheses to answer real-world research questions. Finally, we will explore how many participants should be enrolled to provide robust conclusions when designing a study.\nThe core course can be studied in an online or in-person mode (or a mixture of both), and teaches you to how to obtain and interpret biostatistical output using software, while minimising mathematical formulae.\nI invite you to learn how to tell a story using data.\nTimothy Dobbins\nphcm9795.biostats@unsw.edu.au",

    "text": "Generative AI statement\nThis work was developed with the assistance of NotebookLM\n\n1. RStudio Setup & Basics\n\nInstall R: Download from https://cran.r-project.org/. [Section 1.12]\nInstall RStudio: Download from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. You must install R before installing RStudio. [Section 1.12]\nRStudio Preferences: Set to not preserve workspace between sessions by deselecting “Restore .RData into workplace at startup” and choosing “Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never” (Mac: Edit &gt; Settings, Windows: Tools &gt; Global Options). [Section 1.12]\nCreate a Project to simplify file navigation: File &gt; New Project… &gt; New Directory &gt; New Project, then provide a directory name (e.g., PHCM9795) and browse for location. [Section 1.12]\nStart a new R Script: File &gt; New File &gt; R Script (or Ctrl+Shift+N/Command+Shift+N). Write commands here to save your work. [Section 1.12]\nRun a Script: Code &gt; Run Region &gt; Run All or select all the code, and use Ctrl+Enter or Command+Enter. [Section 1.12]\nComments: Use # to add comments, which R ignores. [Section 1.12]\nObject Assignment: Use &lt;- (e.g., x &lt;- 42) to create objects. [Section 1.12]\nVectors: Best thought of as columns of data. Combine values of the same type using the combine function: c() (e.g., age &lt;- c(20, 25, 23, 29, 21, 27)). [Section 1.12]\nData Frames: Essentially a spreadsheet of columns. [Section 1.12]\nConvert a single column to a data frame: Some packages (e.g. jmv) can only work with data frames, not single columns. Convert a single column to a data frame using as.data.frame() (e.g., age_df &lt;- as.data.frame(age)). [Section 3.21]\nCase Sensitivity: R is case-sensitive (e.g., age, Age, AGE are all different names). [Section 1.12]\n\n\n\n2. Packages\n\nInstall a package: Use install.packages(\"package_name\") (e.g., install.packages(\"jmv\")) or Tools &gt; Install Packages. Packages only need to be installed once for your R installation. [Section 1.12]\nLoad a package: Use library(package_name) (e.g., library(jmv)). Must be done in each R session before using the package. [Section 1.12]\n\n\n\n3. Data Handling & Manipulation\n\nReading in data:\n\nR data file (.rds): readRDS(\"file_path.rds\") (e.g., pbc &lt;- readRDS(\"data/activities/mod01_pbc.rds\")). [Section 1.13]\nComma Separated Values (.csv): read.csv(\"file_path.csv\") (e.g., sample &lt;- read.csv(\"data/examples/mod02_weight_1000.csv\")). [Section 2.20]\nExcel file (.xlsx): read_excel(\"file_path.xlsx\") from readxl package (e.g., survey &lt;- read_excel(\"data/examples/mod03_health_survey.xlsx\")). [Section 3.18]\n\nView data:\n\nsummary(dataframe): Quick overview of all variables. [Section 1.13]\nskim(dataframe) (from skimr package): Provides detailed summaries and rudimentary histograms. [Section 1.13]\nhead(dataframe): Shows the first 6 rows. [Section 3.19]\ntail(dataframe): Shows the last 6 rows. [Section 3.19]\nsubset(dataframe, condition): Lists observations meeting a condition (e.g., subset(sample, weight&gt;200)). [Section 1.14]\n\nModify data:\n\nCreate New Variable: dataframe$new_variable &lt;- formula (e.g., survey$bmi &lt;- survey$weight / (survey$height^2)). [Section 3.19]\nAssign Meaningful Names: recommended for easy to read output. Simplest way is to create a new column: dataframe$newvariablename &lt;- datafram$oldvariable. Spaces and punctuation can be incorporated by surrounding the new variable name in quotation marks: dataframe$\"new variable name (units)\" &lt;- datafram$oldvariable.\nConvert to Factor (Categorical Variable): dataframe$variable &lt;- factor(dataframe$variable, levels=c(values), labels=c(\"labels\")) (e.g., pbc$sex &lt;- factor(pbc$sex, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c(\"Male\", \"Female\"))). [Module 2, R notes]\nRe-order Factor Levels: relevel(dataframe$factor_variable, ref=\"first_level\") (e.g., drug$group &lt;- relevel(drug$group, ref=\"Active\")). Essential for correct calculation of measures of effect like RR or OR. [Section 6.13]\nRecode Continuous to Categorical: cut(dataframe$continuous_var, breaks=c(limits), labels=c(\"labels\")) (e.g., pbc$agegroup &lt;- cut(pbc$age, breaks = c(0, 30, 50, 70, 100), right = FALSE, labels = c(\"Less than 30\", \"30 to less than 50\", \"50 to less than 70\", \"70 or more\"))). [Section 2.21]\nSet value to missing (NA): dataframe$variable = ifelse(condition, NA, dataframe$variable) (e.g., sample$weight_clean = ifelse(sample$weight==700.2, NA, sample$weight)). [Section 1.14]\nLog transformation: dataframe$new_var &lt;- log(dataframe$old_var) (e.g., hospital$ln_los &lt;- log(hospital$los+1)). [Section 9.12]\nBack-transform from log: exp(log_transformed_value) (e.g., exp(3.407232)). [Section 9.12]\n\n\n\n\n4. Descriptive Statistics (Numerical)\n\nContinuous data:\n\nsummary(vector): Basic summary (Minimum, 1st Quartile, Median, Mean, 3rd Quartile, Maximum). [Section 1.13]\ndescriptives(data=dataframe, vars=c(var1, var2), pc=TRUE, ci=TRUE, splitBy=group_var) (from jmv): Comprehensive descriptive statistics, including percentiles, confidence interval of the mean, and can split by a categorical variable. [Section 1.13; Section 3.20]\n\nCategorical data:\n\nOne-way Frequency Table: descriptives(data=dataframe, vars=variable, freq=TRUE) (from jmv). [Module 2, R notes]\nTwo-way Frequency Table (Cross-tabulation): contTables(data=dataframe, rows=row_var, cols=col_var) (from jmv). Use pcCol=TRUE for column percents, and pcRow=TRUE for row percents. Use count=n for summarised data. [Module 2, R notes; Section 7.11]\n\n\n\n\n5. Descriptive Statistics (Graphical)\n\nContinuous data:\n\nDensity plot: plot(density(dataframe$variable, na.rm=TRUE), xlab=\"Label\", main=\"Title\"). Can also use descriptives() function in jmv, with the dens=TRUE option (e.g. descriptives(data=dataframe, vars=varname, dens=TRUE). [Section 1.13]\nBox plot: boxplot(dataframe$variable, xlab=\"Label\", main=\"Title\"). Can also use descriptives() function in jmv, with the box=TRUE option. [Section 1.13]\nScatter plot: plot(x=dataframe$x_var, y=dataframe$y_var, xlab=\"X Label\", ylab=\"Y Label\"). Add regression line: abline(lm(dataframe$y_var ~ dataframe$x_var)). Can also use scat(data=dataframe, x=\"X_var\", y=\"Y_var\", line=\"linear\") from scatr package. [Section 8.13]\n\nCategorical data (Bar Charts):\n\nOne Categorical Variable: plot(dataframe$categorical_var, main=\"Title\", ylab=\"Number of participants\"). [Section 2.18]\nTwo Categorical Variables (from jmv package):\n\nClustered (side-by-side): contTables(data=dataframe, rows=row_var, cols=col_var, barplot=TRUE, xaxis=\"xcols\"). [Section 2.19]\nStacked: contTables(data=dataframe, rows=row_var, cols=col_var, barplot=TRUE, xaxis=\"xcols\", bartype=\"stack\"). [Section 2.19]\nStacked relative frequency: contTables(data=dataframe, rows=row_var, cols=col_var, barplot=TRUE, bartype=\"stack\", xaxis=\"xcols\", yaxis=\"ypc\", yaxisPc=\"column_pc\"). [Section 2.19]\n\nTwo Categorical Variables (from surveymv package): surveyPlot(data=dataframe, vars=\"var_to_plot\", group=\"grouping_var\", type=\"stacked\"/\"grouped\", freq=\"perc\"/\"count\"). [Section 2.19]\n\n\n\n\n6. Probability Distributions\nWhile R has functions to calculate probabilities, external applets may be easier.\n\nBinomial probabilities https://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/applets/bin.html\nBinomial distribution in R [Section 2.22]:\n\nProbability of exactly x successes: dbinom(x=k, size=n, prob=p).\nProbability of q or fewer successes: pbinom(q=k, size=n, prob=p).\nProbability of more than q successes: pbinom(q=k, size=n, prob=p, lower.tail=FALSE).\n\nNormal probabilities https://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/applets/normal.html\nNormal distribution in R [Section 3.22]:\n\nProbability of q or less: pnorm(q, mean, sd).\nProbability of more than q: pnorm(q, mean, sd, lower.tail=FALSE).\n\n\n\n\n7. Confidence Intervals\n\nProportions: BinomCI(x=k, n=n, method='wilson') (from DescTools package). [Section 6.11]\nMean (individual data): descriptives(data=dataframe, vars=variable, ci=TRUE) (from jmv). [Section 3.23]\nMean (summarised data): Use the custom ci_mean function provided in the notes, e.g. ci_mean(n=242, mean=128.4, sd=19.56, width=0.95). [Section 3.24]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Hypothesis Testing\n\nOne-Sample T-test: t.test(dataframe$variable, mu=hypothesised_mean). [Section 4.12]\nIndependent Samples T-test:\n\nttestIS(data=dataframe, vars=continuous_var, group=group_var, meanDiff=TRUE, ci=TRUE, welchs=TRUE) (from jmv). [Section 5.9]\nAlternative base R: t.test(continuous_var ~ group_var, data=dataframe, var.equal=FALSE) [Section 5.9]\n\nPaired T-test:\n\nttestPS(data=dataframe, pairs=list(list(i1=\"var1\", i2=\"var2\")), meanDiff=TRUE, ci=TRUE) (from jmv). [Section 5.11]\nAlternative base R: t.test(dataframe$var1, dataframe$var2, paired=TRUE). [Section 5.11]\n\nOne-Sample Proportion (Binomial Test): binom.test(x=successes, n=trials, p=hypothesised_proportion). Also prop.test() for z-test. [Section 6.12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback? Contact me at phcm9795.biostatistics@unsw.edu.au"

Are there any preparatory courses I should study?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it has been a while since you have studied maths, the resources from Unit 1 of the Algebra Basics from the Khan Academy might be useful.\nDon’t worry that it’s got “algebra” in its title, it’s just some basic maths skills that you might not remember so well. And don’t feel like you need to formally enrol, or study every section: just watch some of the videos and read some of the notes for the topics that you might not remember - and maybe take some of the quizzes. I would recommend the section on “Order of Operations”, but you can definitely skip “Area of triangles” and “Circumference and area of circles”.",
