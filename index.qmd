# Course information

Biostatistics is a foundational discipline needed for the analysis and interpretation of quantitative information and its application to population health policy and practice.

This course is central to becoming a population health practitioner as the concepts and techniques developed in the course are fundamental to your studies and practice in population health. In this course you will develop an understanding of, and skills in, the core concepts of biostatistics that are necessary for analysis and interpretation of population health data and health literature.

In designing this course, we provide a learning sequence that will allow you to obtain the required graduate capabilities identified for your program. This course is taught with an emphasis on formulating a hypothesis and quantifying the evidence in relation to a specific research question. You will have the opportunity to analyse data from different study types commonly seen in population health research.

The course will allow those of you who have covered some of this material in your undergraduate and other professional education to consolidate your knowledge and skills.Â  Students exposed to biostatistics for the first time may find the course challenging at times. Based on student feedback, the key to success in this course is to devote time to it *every* week. We recommend that you spend an average of 10-15 hours per week on the course, including the time spent reading the course notes and readings, listening to lectures, and working through learning activities and completing your assessments. Please use the resources provided to assist you, including online support.
