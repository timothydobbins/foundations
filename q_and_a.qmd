## Class attendance and enrolment questions

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## How is this course taught: in-person or online?

Foundations of Biostatistics is taught using both in-person and online modes. Lectures are delivered in-person, and are also live-streamed and recorded. We have both in-person and online tutorials, and the online tutorials are recorded.

## Are there any attendance requirements?

There are no attendance requirements. Many students don't come to campus, and the course is designed to be accessible by all students regardless of where they live.

## I can only study one course this term. Should I study Foundations of Biostatistics or Foundations of Epidemiology?

There is no right answer to this question - completing either course first would be fine.

Many students put off studying Foundations of Biostatistics in the (mistaken) belief that it will be too difficult - and then report that they wish they had studied the course earlier. Foundations of Biostatistics is designed to be accessible for all students, regardless of your maths background.

Your future course choices and your timetable might help you answer this. For example, if you know you want to complete Regression Methods in Biostatistics, then completing Foundations of Biostatistics first would be sensible.

You will get a lot out of either course, whatever you decide to complete first.

## Expected background knowledge

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Are there any prerequisites or expected background knowledge for this course? For example, does the course require university-level mathematics?

There are no prerequisite maths skills - you certainly don't need to have studied mathematics or statistics at university. I will touch on some high-school maths, but very infrequently.
It's been a long time since I've studies maths, and I'm feeling nervous. Are there any preparatory courses I should study?

If it has been a while since you have studied maths, the resources from [Unit 1 of the Algebra Basics from the Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics/basic-alg-foundations) might be useful.
 
Don’t worry that it’s got “algebra” in its title, it’s just some basic maths skills that you might not remember so well. And don’t feel like you need to formally enrol, or study every section: just watch some of the videos and read some of the notes for the topics that you might not remember - and maybe take some of the quizzes. I would recommend the section on “Order of Operations”, but you can definitely skip “Area of triangles” and “Circumference and area of circles”.

## Workload and assessment

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## What is the workload for the course?

Foundations of Biostatistics is a 6 unit of credit course. UNSW suggests a workload of 150 hours over the term for a 6 UOC course.

Foundations of Biostatistics comprises four hours of formal teaching per week: lectures (two hours) and tutorials (two hours).

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## What assessment tasks are required for the course?

There are four quizzes (each worth 5%) to help students keep up with the material as it is presented through the course. There are also two assignments, each worth 40% of the course. The dates for these assessments will be released when the course outline is published.

## Do I need to buy a calculator?

No, you do not need to buy a calculator.

All work will be performed using statistical software, and plenty of instructions will be provided.
